# Seperated Multiple C/C++ Manually VScode(mac)

This is a setup for multiple C/C++ files under different folder to build, 

compile and debug with VSCode on mac.

Amazing Notice:

Please double check the filename of the VSCode configuration file.

e.g:

`tasks.json`

`launch.json`

`c_cpp_properties.json`

`settings.json`

A week ago, I made a mistake: I wrote "tasks.json" as "task.json". As a result,

VSCode always reports the error "cannot find tasks.json file". I always thought:

I wrote "task.json", why there is no "tasks.json". It took a week to change the

configuration file, only to find out today that there is a problem with the file

naming. Oh! I am silly.

Notice: 

This is my workspace environment!

Code Runner v0.11.6 (Author: Jun Han);

CodeLLDB v1.4.5 or v1.5.0 (Author: Vadim Chugunov).

Now:

This workspace named `fitBody`, including 4 directories, 7 files.

`inc`: source file folder.

`fitbody.h`: This project connected include function.

`build`: build task folder, Debug folder, Executable file.

`.vscode`: VSCode configuration folder.

`tasks.json`: This task will invoke the Clang C++ compiler to create an 

executable file from the source code.

`settings.json`: Workspace Settings.

`launch.json`: configure VS Code to launch the LLDB debugger when you press

`F5` to debug the program.

`c_cpp_properties.json`: allows you to change settings such as the path to
